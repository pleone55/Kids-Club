# Kids-Club

Project replicating the Kids Club management system from Gyms that tracks the kids that are checked in to Kids Club. First part of the project replicates the system
displaying the kids checked in, as well as being able to create, update and delete the kids. The second part is a mobile application for the parents to be able to view
when Kid's Club is full in order to help manage their time wisely before entering the gym.
